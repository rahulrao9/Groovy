Avery Anna) (Live Performance)\nDebut album 'Restless Mind' out now: https://sambarber.lnk.to/RestlessMindID\n\nLyrics: \nI know you're worried at night that I won't find my way\nAnd I'm tired of lying to myself just to get through each day\nMy head says I should have never left, and that my feet will soon lead to my death\n\nI'm starting to question if god\u2019s trying to teach me a lesson\nI'm starting to wonder if my true colors changed since I left ya\n\nI used to shine bright like gold, but now I'm all indigo\nMy colors are darker and cold\nI think it's time that I went home\nAnd I don't understand why I always feel dead and alone\nI used to shine bright like gold\nNow I'm all indigo\n\nGave up a piece of my heart then I turned to run\nMy head is in the clouds but I don't feel close to the sun\nAnd the light fades away from my face and the tears fall like rain\nSo I turn all my words into faith, hope it's me that they save\n\nI'm starting to question if god\u2019s trying to teach me a lesson\nLord know I'm starting to wonder if my true colors changed since I left ya\n\nI used to shine bright like gold, but now I'm all indigo\nMy colors are darker and cold\nI think it's time that I went home\nAnd I don't understand why I always feel dead and alone\nI used to shine bright like gold\nNow I'm all indigo\n\nI'm starting to question if god\u2019s trying to teach me a lesson\nLord know I'm starting to wonder if my true colors changed since I left ya\n\nI used to shine bright like gold, but now I'm all indigo\nMy colors are darker and cold\nI think it's time that I went home\nAnd I don't understand why I always feel dead and alone\nI used to shine bright like gold\nNow I'm all indigo\nNow I'm all indigo\n\nFollow Sam Barber: \nhttps://sambarbermusic.com\nhttps://www.instagram.com/sambarber_music\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@sambarber_music\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@sambarber9852\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sambarbermusic2\nhttps://sambarber.lnk.to/Spotify\nhttps://sambarber.lnk.to/AppleMusic\n\n#SamBarber #Indigo #AveryAnna #RestlessMind #OfficialAudio",
